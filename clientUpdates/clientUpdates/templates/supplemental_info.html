<p>Please reference the information below to help understand important elements and requirements of the 3M/DuPont and Tyco/BASF
Supplemental Fund claims. If you require additional assistance, please use the <a style="color:blue;" href="{% url 'contact_default' %}">contact</a> form.</p>

    <h5 style="border-bottom:2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)">Background Information</h5>

    <p>The Supplemental Funds, relative to both 3M/DuPont and Tyco/BASF action fund claims, are designed to compensate Public Water Systems (PWS)
    in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="text-align:left;">When a source was "unimpacted" (i.e., there was no measureable concentration
            of PFAS detected in the water source) at the time of filing the action fund claim but has since
            exhibited detections of PFAS; OR</li>

        <br>

        <li style="text-align:left;">When a source exhibited PFAS detections <strong>below</strong> the Proposed Federal PFAS Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) or applicable State PFAS MCLs at
                the time of filing the action fund claim, but have since had one or more PFAS detections above the Proposed Federal PFAS MCLs or applicable State PFAS MCLs.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" style="display:flex">
        <i class="bi bi-info-circle h5" style="padding-right:5px; color:blue; width:5%"></i>
        <p style="margin: 0px;">Note that, based on the above, there are a maximum of two (2) opportunities for a PWS to submit a Supplemental Fund Claim for a given "unimpacted" source. For example,
            suppose a source by the name of "Well-1" is deemed "unimpacted" at the time of the action fund claim filing. The first Supplemental
            Fund Claim that could be filed for Well-1 is when the first PFAS detection is identified for the source, but said detection is below
        the Proposed Federal PFAS MCLs and any applicable State PFAS MCLs. The second Supplemental Fund Claim that can be filed for Well-1 is when PFAS detections go
        from being <strong>below</strong> Proposed Federal MCLs and any applicable State PFAS MCLs to <strong>exceeding</strong> any Proposed Federal
        MCLs and any applicable State PFAS MCLs. </p>

    <h5 style="border-bottom:2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)">Timeframe</h5>
    <p>Supplemental Fund claims, for both 3M/Dupont and Tyco/BASF, can be submitted up to and including December 31, 2030.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in submitting a supplemental claim relative to either 3M/DuPont or Tyco/BASF, please notify EH&E by
    navigating to the appropriate "Supplemental Fund Claims" portion of this website and following the on-screen instructions. For example,
    if you are trying to submit a Supplemental Fund Claim relative to 3M/DuPont, click the "3M/DuPont" dropdown in the navigation bar, then
    click on "Supplemental Fund Claims" &mdash; this site will have instructions on how to proceed. </p>

    <p><span class="bold-italic-underline">Proposed Federal PFAS MCLs:</span> This refers to the federal PFAS MCLs proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
        in 88 Fed. Reg. 18,638, 18,748 (March 29, 2023). In summary, the EPA proposed the following MCLs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PFOS:</strong> 4 ng/L (ppt)</li>
        <li><strong>PFOA:</strong> 4 ng/L (ppt)</li>
        <li>A Hazard Index (HI) of 1.0 relative to the combined Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the following four analytes:
            <ol>
                <li style="padding: 10px 0px 5px 0px;">PFHxS (reference value of 9 ppt)</li>
                <li style="padding: 5px 0px;">HFPO-DA (reference value of 10 ppt)</li>
                <li style="padding: 5px 0px;">PFNA (reference value of 10 ppt)</li>
                <li style="padding: 5px 0px 10px 0px;">PFBS (reference value of 2000 ppt)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <p> The last MCL requires some more explanation. A HQ is calculated by dividing a measured concentration of an analyte
            by some reference value. The reference value for each analyte is provided in the list above. So, for example, the
            HQ for a source with a measured PFNA concentration of 5 ppt would be calculated as follows:
        <div>
            <math display="block" style="font-size:18px; margin:auto;">
                <msub>
                    <mi>HQ</mi>
                    <mi>PFNA</mi>
                </msub>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mfrac>
                    <msub>
                      <mi>5.0 ppt</mi>
                      <mi>PFNA-measured</mi>
                    </msub>
                    <msub>
                      <mi>10.0 ppt</mi>
                      <mi>PFNA-reference</mi>
                    </msub>
                </mfrac>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mn>0.5</mn>
            </math>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>So, to determine the HI relative to PFHxS, HFPO-DA, PFNA, and PFBS, the following equation can be used:</p>
        <div>
            <math display="block" style="font-size:18px; margin:auto;">
                <mi>HI</mi>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <msub>
                    <mi>HQ</mi>
                    <mi>PFHxS</mi>
                </msub>
                <mo>+</mo>
                <msub>
                    <mi>HQ</mi>
                    <mi>HFPO-DA</mi>
                </msub>
                <mo>+</mo>
                <msub>
                    <mi>HQ</mi>
                    <mi>PFNA</mi>
                </msub>
                <mo>+</mo>
                <msub>
                    <mi>HQ</mi>
                    <mi>PFBS</mi>
                </msub>
            </math>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><span class="bold-italic-underline">State PFAS MCLs: </span>These are state-specific MCLs for PFAS analytes that were effective at or before the Settlement Date relative to
    3M/DuPont and Tyco/BASF, as applicable.</p>
